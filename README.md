** Work / Project Examples **

1. Mobiant.com
This website is basically an e-commerce website. It looks like amazon. Main aim of project is to allow customers purchase their products and user authentication. I have mostly worked on fetching data from API using AXIOS. I have created a live search feature where customers can search any products word by word and used filter method for sorting all the product names. I have also worked on designing UI based components using bootstrap, reactJs and redux for state management. I have also used chrome dev tools, react dev tools for debugging and also used git for project management.

2. Tesla Clone
This clone is similar to tesla.com. I have built this clone for learning purpose. In this clone, I have worked on all the modules. Firstly, I walked through tesla.com and created a roadmap for development. Then, I have started developing this clone using reactJs. Used redux for managing different components and used styled components for designing user interface and also used material-UI for icons. I have also designed some animations and used git for project management.

3. Adventour
Designed a website from scratch that helps users to find their tour destinations through an organized and user-friendly platform. Main aim for this project was to give users a friendly environment where they can select their holiday destinations easily and quickly. I have led the project and divided a work in a team. I have designed a layout for home page and destination page and also verified the work done by team.

** Inspiration **

1. https://www.tesla.com/
One day I was looking tesla website just for fun and I found this website is so exciting. this website looks so simple and pretty good interface still it shows every detailed information of cars. I compared other car websites with tesla and I saw a clear difference between them. thatâ€™s the reason I have tried to build a tesla clone inspired by tesla but it was very difficult to implement. From that point I understood How difficult is to create unique website compare to good websites.


** Focus **

If I get the time and resources, I will definitely try to understand how this company works. I will try to learn new concepts and I will try to learn how every team members work together and I will try to learn as much I can from senior developers and manager on an ongoing project. During 6 months I will start learning new concepts and get guidance from senior developers. 


** Code Challenge **
